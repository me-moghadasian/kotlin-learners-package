# Kotlin Learners Package

## Description

This package offers a concise introduction to Kotlin (using JupyterLab), focusing only on the essential concepts and skills. It covers the fundamental topics necessary for understanding and practicing (or reviewing) Kotlin, including:

- [Introduction](01-intro.ipynb)
- [Functions](02-functions.ipynb)
- [Lambdas](03-lambdas.ipynb)
- [Collections](04-collections.ipynb)
- [Objects](05-objects.ipynb)
- [Classes](06-classes.ipynb)
- [OOP: Introduction](07-oop-intro.ipynb)
- [Useful Kotlin Classes](08-useful-classes.ipynb)
- [OOP: interfaces](09-oop-interfaces.ipynb)
- [Equality check, 'is' and 'as' operators](10-equal-is-as.ipynb)
- [Asynchronous programming introduction](11-async-intro.ipynb)
- [TBD]



## Who should use this?

This project is designed for **intermediate-level** developers who are looking to deepen their understanding of *core concepts* in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). It is particularly beneficial for those who want to expand their knowledge, **review general principles**, or gain a broader perspective on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). If you are an **expert** in this field, you might find the material **NOT** directly applicable to advanced scenarios. However, if you are eager to refresh your foundational skills or explore different approaches, this resource may still offer valuable insights

## Active Development

Please note that this package is *actively being modified and updated*. We are continuously working to improve and expand the content based on feedback and new developments in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). New features, topics, and enhancements will be added over time.

## Features [TBD]

- **Introduction**: ...
- **And More...**

To get started with this package, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   - Refer to [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install Python.
      
2. **Install Kotlin and Java**:
   - Ensure you have [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html) and the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed. Kotlin runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), so you'll need both.

3. **Install the Kotlin Jupyter Kernel**:
   - You need the [Kotlin Jupyter Kernel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) for Jupyter to run Kotlin code. You can install it using the following commands:
     ```bash
     pip install kotlin-jupyter-kernel
     python -m kotlin_jupyter_kernel.install
     ```

4. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/me-moghadasian/kotlin-learners-package.git
    ```

5. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd kotlin-learners-package
    ```

6. **Install JupyterLab** (if not already installed):
   - If you don't have JupyterLab installed, you'll need Python and JupyterLab. You can install JupyterLab using:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

7. **Start JupyterLab**:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

8. **Open and Explore the Notebooks and Scripts**:
   - Use JupyterLab to open and explore the notebooks and scripts provided in the package.

## Note

This package is still under development. New features and improvements will be added over time.
