    "# Introducing Kotlin **Channels**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kotlin **Channels** are a powerful feature of Kotlin **Coroutines** that provide a way to **communicate between coroutines**. They are similar to blocking queues and allow for asynchronous data exchange while providing safe synchronization.\n",
    "- **Non-blocking**: Channels enable asynchronous communication without blocking threads, making it easier to build responsive applications.\n",
    "- **Channels** facilitate communication between coroutines by allowing one coroutine to send data and another to receive it.\n",
    "- **Hot stream**: Unlike flows, channels are **hot streams**, meaming they continuously produce values and can emit data regardless of whether there are active collectors.\n",
    "- Types of Channels:\n",
    "  1. **Rendezvous Channels**: These are the default channels where the sender is suspended until the receiver is ready to receive the data.\n",
    "  2. **Buffered Channels**: These channels *can hold a specified number of elements*, allowing the sender to send data *without waiting for the receiver* until the buffer is full.\n",
    "  3. **Conflated Channels**: These *only keep the latest value sent to the channel*, discarding older values. This is useful for scenarios where only the latest data matters.\n",
