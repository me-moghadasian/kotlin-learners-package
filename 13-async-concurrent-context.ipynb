    "## Coroutine `Context`\n",
    "\n",
    "- A coroutine **context** in Kotlin is a set of elements that define the behavior of a coroutine. It holds information such as the **dispatcher** (which determines which *thread* or *threads* the coroutine runs on), a **Job** that *controls the lifecycle* of the coroutine, and other optional elements that can customize coroutine execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Job`\n",
    "    - A `Job` controls the lifecycle of the coroutine. It can be used to track and manage the coroutine's state (active, canceled, or completed).\n",
    "    - The `Job` is part of the **context**, and every coroutine has an associated `Job`.\n",
    "3. `CoroutineDispatcher`\n",
    "    - `Dispatchers.Default`: Uses a shared background pool of threads and is optimized for CPU-intensive tasks.\n",
    "    - `Dispatchers.IO`: Optimized for I/O-bound tasks such as reading from files or network operations.\n",
    "    - `Dispatchers.Main`: Confines the execution to the main thread, often used for updating UI components.\n",
    "    - `Dispatchers.Unconfined`: The coroutine starts on the current thread but can resume on different threads. It is less commonly used.\n",
    "    - **Customised Dispatcher**: It is possible to create a customised dispatcher with a given number of threads.\n",
    "5. `CoroutineName`\n",
    "   - A `CoroutineName` is an optional element that gives a name to a coroutine for debugging purposes."
