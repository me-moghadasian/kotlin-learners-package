    "- **Use cases**: Simple signaling between threads, sharing state between threads, but with potential race conditions.\n",

    "- While `volatile` variables ensure visibility, they **DO NOT guarantee** any specific **ordering** of operations.\n",
    "- It guarantees that any **read or write** to that variable will be directly **from and to main memory**, rather than using thread-local caches.\n",
    "- Using `volatile` variables **can introduce some performance overhead**, as they require additional synchronization mechanisms.\n",
    "- They **DO NOT guarantee** atomicity. For example, operations like incrementing a value `x++` are not atomic, even if `x` is declared `volatile`. We'll need to use **locks** or **atomic** variables (AtomicInteger, etc.) for that.\n",
    "- A `synchronized` block can be used along with `volatile` variables that **blocks** other threads that attempt to access the same section of code while one thread is already executing it. This ensures atomicity."
