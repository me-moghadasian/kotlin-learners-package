    "1. **Coroutines Must Have a Well-Defined Scope**: All coroutines must be launched within a specific **scope** (e.g., `CoroutineScope`, `runBlocking`, or a lifecycle scope). When this scope is **cancelled**, *all coroutines launched within it are automatically cancelled.*\n",
    "2. **Cancellation Propagation**: If the *parent scope* is cancelled, all the coroutines within that scope are cancelled as well. This helps *prevent memory leaks* by ensuring that no coroutines are left running without control (There is an exception that will be dicusssed).\n",
    "3. **Hierarchy of Coroutines**: Child coroutines are bound to their parent coroutines. If a parent coroutine is cancelled or fails, *all its child coroutines are cancelled as well*. This creates a structured tree of coroutines, where failures and cancellations are propagated correctly.\n",
    "4. **Exceptions Handling**: In structured concurrency, *exceptions are propagated through the coroutine hierarchy*. If a child coroutine throws an exception, it affects the parent coroutine unless caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: When cancellation request is sent by calling `cancel()`, it is JUST initiated; The point at which the parent coroutine and its children cancel, **depends on the structure of the code**."
