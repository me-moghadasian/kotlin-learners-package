    "## Using `StateFlow`/`MutableStateFlow`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `StateFlow` is a specialized type of Kotlin `Flow` designed to handle state-sharing scenarios. It is essentially a **hot stream** of data, meaning it always **holds the latest value** and emits it to new collectors.\n",
    "- **Hot Stream**: Unlike regular flows that are **cold**, `StateFlow` is **hot** and continuously holds the latest value, which is immediately available to any collector.\n",
    "- **Initial State**: It requires an initial value, ensuring that it always contains a state.\n",
    "- **Mutability**: A `MutableStateFlow` is used to *update the state*, while `StateFlow` is the *read-only* version for consumers.\n",
    "- **State Retention**: New subscribers *immediately receive the current state*, not just future updates.\n",
    "- **No Backpressure**: `StateFlow` does not handle backpressure, which may be a consideration in high-demand data streams.\n",
    "- **StateFlow Termination**: They emit data indefinitely unless their corotuine context closes; in that case they get closed automatically."

    "- A hot `Flow` that **shares** emitted values among all its collectors in a broadcast fashion, so that **all collectors** get **all emitted values**. It is not like channels when collectors consume data.\n",
    "- `SharedFlow` is a **hot stream** Kotlin coroutine flow that allows multiple consumers to receive the same values emitted by **a single producer**. Unlike regular flows, which are consumed by **only one consumer**, `SharedFlows` can be shared among many.\n",
    "- **Internal Buffering**: `SharedFlows` can have a buffer to store emitted values..\n",
    "- **Replay**: `SharedFlows` can replay a certain number of **past emissions** to **new consumers**, providing a way to **catch up on missed events**. New subscribers (collectors) will get the data stored in the replay cache.\n",
    "- **Share-In**: We can use `.shareIn()` to create a **hot stream** `SharedState` from a **cold** `Flow`."
